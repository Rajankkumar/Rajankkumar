**Project Summary:**

The Business Analytics Capstone Project involved an in-depth analysis of financial data from Western countries using various tools and technologies such as SQL, Excel, and Power BI. The project aimed to derive valuable insights regarding sales, profits, discounts, and trends across different segments, products, and countries.

**Detailed Project Description:**

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Excel:** The project began with exploring the dataset in Excel to gain a better understanding of the data structure, key variables, and initial trends. This step involved summarizing the dataset and identifying any potential issues or inconsistencies.

**Data Cleaning and Statistical Analysis:** After the initial exploration, the dataset underwent a thorough cleaning process to address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Statistical analysis techniques were then applied to identify patterns, correlations, and trends within the data.

**Graphical Analysis using Excel:** Graphical representations such as histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts were created in Excel to visualize relationships between variables and derive actionable insights. These visualizations provided a clear understanding of the data distribution and key metrics.

Database Creation and SQL Integration: A SQL database was set up to store and manage the dataset efficiently. The dataset was imported into the SQL server, and necessary parameters and tables were defined to facilitate data manipulation and analysis.

Power BI Integration: The cleaned and transformed dataset was imported into Power BI for further analysis and visualization. Power BI provided a powerful platform for creating interactive dashboards and reports to present the findings of the analysis.

**Dashboard Creation in Power BI:** A detailed interactive dashboard was developed in Power BI to showcase the insights derived from the analysis. The dashboard included visualizations for various actionable questions such as product-wise sales, segment-wise profit, yearly sales, country-wise sales, etc.

Dashboard Interactivity: The dashboard was designed to be fully interactive, allowing stakeholders to filter the data by date, country, product, and segments. This interactivity enhanced user experience and facilitated informed decision-making.

**Conclusion and Recommendations:** The project concluded with a summary of key findings and insights derived from the analysis. Recommendations were provided based on the insights to guide stakeholders in making data-driven decisions to optimize business strategies and maximize profitability.

**GitHub Repository:**

All project details, including datasets, code scripts, and documentation, were organized and uploaded to a GitHub repository for easy access and collaboration. The repository served as a central hub for the project, allowing stakeholders to review the analysis, access the dashboard, and contribute to further development and improvement.
